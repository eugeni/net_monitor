TODO for net_monitor:

 - show advanced values (netmask, broadcast, MTU, flags, ...)
 - implement advanced logging (start and stop counting network transfers,
   accounting number of packets, bytes, and so on)
 - correctly detect when device is active
 - highlight interfaces with higher transmission rate
