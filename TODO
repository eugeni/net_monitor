TODO for net_monitor:

 - show advanced values (netmask, broadcast, MTU, flags, ...)
 - implement advanced logging (start and stop counting network transfers,
   accounting number of packets, bytes, and so on)
 - highlight interfaces with higher transmission rate
 - auto-detect new and removed interfaces (ppp0, etc)
 - advanced fields:
   - known ARP addresses per interface
   - known routes per interface
   - advanced network statistics (/proc/net/netstat)
   - socket statistics
   - ip forwarding (/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward)
